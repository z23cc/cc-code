# Changelog

## [5.19.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added (Ruflo inspired)
- **Infinite Context Autopilot** — survives context compaction:
  - PreCompact hook saves critical state to `.tasks/compaction_context.json`: active chain, current skill, recent skill contexts (last 3), wisdom (last 5 per category), git state, active tasks, chain metrics
  - SessionStart hook restores and displays: `# RESTORED CONTEXT (from pre-compaction save)`
  - Shows: branch, last commit, active chain + step, current skill, in-progress tasks, recent wisdom, skill context keys
  - Zero config — works automatically on every compaction event

## [5.18.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added (gmickel flow-next inspired)
- **`/cc-deps`** — dependency graph skill: blocking chains, parallel execution phases, critical path analysis, ready-to-start recommendations. Answers "what should I work on next?" (78 skills, 67 commands)

## [5.17.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added (Everything Claude Code inspired)
- **`/cc-product-lens`** — product thinking before building: founder review, PMF scoring (0-50), user journey audit, RICE prioritization. BUILD/VALIDATE/DEFER decision.
- **`/cc-browser-qa`** — automated visual QA: smoke tests, Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS/TTFB), WCAG AA accessibility, responsive breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop), dark mode, visual regression baselines.
- **`/cc-team-builder`** — dynamic agent composition: analyzes task (file types, domains, complexity), checks past success from wisdom system, recommends optimal team + execution mode.
- 3 new skills + commands (77 skills, 66 commands total)

## [5.16.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added (BMAD-METHOD inspired)
- **`/cc-architecture` skill** — Solutioning phase: document ADRs (API, data model, auth, testing, deployment) before coding. Inserted into feature chain between plan and tdd as optional step. Prevents multi-agent style conflicts.
- **`/cc-prd-validate` skill** — 10-step PRD validation pipeline: format, density, clarity scoring, SMART validation, traceability, completeness, implementation leakage, measurability. PASS/REVISE verdict.
- **`/cc-elicit` skill** — 8 structured reasoning methods: pre-mortem, first principles, inversion, red team, Socratic, constraint removal, stakeholder mapping, analogical reasoning. Auto-suggests relevant methods based on content type.
- 3 new skills + commands (74 skills, 63 commands total)

## [5.15.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added (AegisFlow inspired)
- **Severity-weighted review consensus** — verdicts based on finding severity, not reviewer vote count:
  - CRITICAL/HIGH finding = NEEDS_WORK even if majority approve
  - 3+ MEDIUM = NEEDS_WORK
  - Each finding must include severity, confidence, and lens
- **`/cc-requirement-gate` skill** — validates requirements before planning:
  - Assesses 5 dimensions: clarity, completeness, complexity, feasibility, testability
  - Decision: PROCEED / CONFIRM / CLARIFY
  - Inserted into feature + idea-to-ship chains (optional step)
- **Agent lens tagging** — each reviewer agent tagged with semantic lens:
  - code-reviewer: "code quality, maintainability, correctness"
  - python-reviewer: "PEP 8, type safety, Pythonic idioms"
  - security-reviewer: "OWASP Top 10, secrets, injection vectors"
  - db-reviewer: "query performance, schema design, migration safety"
- New skill + command: cc-requirement-gate (71 skills, 60 commands total)

## [5.14.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **SKILL.md template validation** (gstack pattern):
  - Enhanced `cc-flow validate-skills` with NOT FOR, flow graph, On Completion checks
  - Cross-reference validation: skill↔command sync, broken flow refs, alias-aware
  - 69 skills validated, 23 real missing commands identified (vs 58 false positives before)
- **`/cc-prd` skill** — Convert PRD/spec to phased implementation plan with architectural decisions, vertical slices, and tracer-bullet first milestone
- **`prd-to-ship` chain** (28 chains total): prd → plan → work → epic-review → ship
  - Full lifecycle from requirements document to deployed code
  - Bridges the brainstorm→plan gap with explicit architectural decisions

## [5.13.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Hook enforcement levels** (PACEflow inspired):
  - `pre-commit-gate.sh`: strict mode **blocks** commits without recent `cc-flow verify` (within 5 min)
  - `mode-guard.sh`: strict mode **blocks** destructive ops (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, git push -f), standard mode warns
  - `cc-flow verify` now records timestamp to `.tasks/last_verify.json` for strict enforcement
- **Runtime hook profiles** (`CC_HOOK_PROFILE` env var):
  - `minimal` — safety hooks only (worktree-guard, mode-guard skip)
  - `standard` — current default behavior (warn but allow)
  - `strict` — all hooks + DENY mode (blocks commits without verify, blocks destructive ops)
- **Complexity-adaptive routing** in `cc-flow go`:
  - Estimates complexity: simple (hotfix keywords, short queries), medium (standard chains), complex (architecture/system/rewrite keywords, long queries)
  - Routes: simple→hotfix chain, medium→matched chain, complex→Ralph
  - Output includes `complexity` field showing why mode was chosen

## [5.12.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Wisdom system** (inspired by CCW) — persistent cross-chain knowledge accumulation:
  - `cc-flow wisdom show/search/add/clear` — manage learnings, decisions, conventions
  - `.tasks/wisdom/{learnings,decisions,conventions}.jsonl` — append-only stores
  - Auto-records on chain completion (chain name, outcome, steps)
  - Search by keyword across all wisdom categories
- **Exploration cache** — prevent redundant research:
  - `cc-flow explore cache/lookup/clear` — manage cached explorations
  - `.tasks/explorations/` with fuzzy query matching (70% word overlap)
  - Cache index for fast lookups
- **Checkpoint supervisor gate** — auto quality checks in long chains:
  - Fires every 2 steps in chains with >3 total steps
  - Runs `cc-flow verify` (lint + tests) + syntax check on changed files
  - Verdict: pass/warn/block — included in `chain advance` output
  - Results persisted in `.tasks/checkpoints/`
- New module: `wisdom.py` (55 modules total)

## [5.11.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **cc-wf-studio integration** — `cc-flow wf` command group for bidirectional workflow interop:
  - `cc-flow wf run <workflow.json>` — execute cc-wf-studio visual workflows natively
  - `cc-flow wf run <workflow.json> --dry-run` — preview execution plan
  - `cc-flow wf list` — list available .vscode/workflows/*.json files
  - `cc-flow wf show <workflow.json>` — show workflow node details
  - `cc-flow wf export <chain>` — export cc-code chain as cc-wf-studio workflow JSON
  - `cc-flow wf export all` — export all 27 chains as visual workflows
- Workflow executor supports: SubAgent, Skill, Prompt, AskUserQuestion, IfElse, Switch, MCP, SubAgentFlow nodes
- Auto-execution instruction format (same as `cc-flow go` chain mode)
- New module: `wf_executor.py` (54 modules total)

### How it works
```
cc-wf-studio (VS Code)    ←→    cc-code (CLI)
  Visual design                  Execute workflows
  .vscode/workflows/*.json       cc-flow wf run
  Export → .claude/commands/     cc-flow wf export
```

## [5.10.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **5 new chains** (27 total): hotfix (3-step fast-track), pr-review, perf-regression, tech-debt, db-migration
- **8 new TEAM_PATTERNS** (14 total): performance, database, api, incident, config, frontend, dependency, devops — aligned with skill chains for better auto-routing
- **Hotfix fast-track** — `cc-flow go "hotfix: fix typo"` routes to 3-step chain (implement → review → commit), skips brainstorm/plan
- **Enforceable workflow gates** in workflow.md:
  - Before commit: verification must pass, chain steps must have context, review must be SHIP
  - Before push: tests pass, no secrets, diff reviewed
  - Before deploy: deps check pass, readiness score ≥ 70
  - After chain: must record learning, metrics auto-tracked

### Improved
- Chain threshold raised from ≤4 to ≤5 required steps (feature chain now executes inline instead of launching Ralph)
- Hotfix keywords bypass chain matching and force chain mode directly
- workflow.md restructured: sequences → gates → dependency protocol → context protocol → auto-learn

## [5.9.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Metrics-boosted chain suggest** — `cc-flow chain suggest` now factors in historical success rates. Chains with higher completion rates get a score bonus (up to +3 points). Output includes run history and success rate.
- **Smart session start** — SessionStart hook now detects and reports:
  - Interrupted chains → recommends `cc-flow go --resume`
  - Active/blocked/ready tasks → recommends next action
  - Uncommitted changes → recommends `git diff`
  - Lint issues → recommends `cc-flow verify --fix`
  - Last commit time
  - All recommendations shown as numbered list with `cc-flow go` as fallback

### Improved
- `chain suggest` output now includes `score`, `history` (runs/success_rate/last_completed), and updated `instruction` pointing to `cc-flow go`
- Session start transitions from static display to dynamic project-aware recommendations

## [5.8.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Chain auto-execution** — `cc-flow go` chain mode now outputs `# AUTO-EXECUTE` instruction with explicit "Do NOT stop between steps" directive, per-step context save/advance commands, and schema hints (outputs/reads)
- **Resume interrupted chains** — `cc-flow go --resume` detects `_chain_state.json` and generates instructions for remaining steps. No-goal invocation hints about interrupted chain.
- **Context schema validation** — `cc-flow chain advance` validates saved context against expected `outputs` keys. Next step's `reads` are checked against available context. Warnings emitted for missing keys.
- 7 new tests: auto-exec instruction format, resume, schema validation

### Improved
- `cc-flow go` chain instruction now self-contained: Claude follows it without manual intervention
- Feature + bugfix chains fully annotated with `outputs`/`reads` per step
- `--resume` flag on `go` command; `goal` arg now optional (for resume-only usage)

## [5.7.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Flow graph coverage 84%** — 38 orphan skills now have FLOWS INTO/DEPENDS ON relationships (was 33%, 21→58 connected)
- **Dependency enforcement** — `cc-flow skill check-deps --skill cc-plan` warns when predecessor context is missing
- **Chain metrics** — `cc-flow chain stats` tracks runs, completions, success rate per chain
- **Context schema hints** — feature + bugfix chains define `outputs`/`reads` keys per step
- **Auto-learn prompt** — chain completion suggests `cc-flow learn` command with outcome

### Improved
- `chain run` records start metrics; `chain advance` records completion metrics
- Scouts → readiness-audit → deploy flow connections established
- Python pack skills (fastapi, database, async, etc.) now flow into tdd/review/refinement
- UI skills chain: ui-ux → web-design → optimize → review

## [5.6.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **`cc-flow go`** — one command full automation: describe your goal, system auto-routes to chain/ralph/auto mode
  - `cc-flow go "fix login bug"` → chain mode (bugfix chain)
  - `cc-flow go "implement user auth"` → ralph mode (autonomous)
  - `cc-flow go "improve code quality"` → auto mode (OODA loop)
  - `--dry-run` to preview without executing, `--mode` to force strategy
- `/cc-go` slash command + skill (69 skills, 58 commands total)
- 19 tests for go module (routing, mode decision, force mode, output format)

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-24
### Added
- **Skill flow graph** — parses FLOWS INTO / DEPENDS ON from all 69 SKILL.md files into queryable graph

  - `cc-flow skill ctx load <name>` — load predecessor's context
  - `cc-flow skill ctx current` — show active skill
- **Context-aware chain execution** — `cc-flow chain run` now loads previous step's context per step
  - `cc-flow chain advance --data '{}'` — save context + advance to next step
  - Chain state persisted for resume across sessions
- **Smart post-task hints** — PostToolUse hook calls `cc-flow skill next` for context-aware suggestions
- **On Completion protocol** — 12 key SKILL.md files updated with standardized completion sections
- `skill_flow.py` module (graph extraction, context protocol, 6 CLI commands)
- 22 tests for skill flow (graph parsing, caching, context, normalization, CLI)
- Skill context protocol documented in `rules/workflow.md`

### Improved
- Post-task-hint hook: detects `cc-flow skill ctx save` and `cc-flow chain advance` for smart next-step suggestions
- Chain run output includes `on_completion` instructions per step and `prev_context` from predecessor

- All skills: TRIGGER + NOT FOR + DEPENDS ON + FLOWS INTO metadata
- All skill/command references: `cc-flow` CLI instead of `python3 cc-flow.py`
- Chain suggest: top-3 alternatives with scoring
- Ralph: goal verification (tests/health/custom) + periodic self-heal scan

### Fixed
